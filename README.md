## 🔍 Overview
                                              
There has been a task that I had to deal with in the early stages after joining HERMES Team. That includes a simple hybrid schema that uses Python and Matlab to create a type of subsystem that could utilize the team's Python code in the Matlab and Simulink environment.

## 🧠 Approach

In general, my MATLAB required almost no modification to run Python. There are functions such as **pyenv** that are useful for setting up Python in MATLAB, as well as **py.sys.version** for checking whether the interface is working.

- USED: Display block, constants(input)/output blocks, Matlab Function Block.

**1) Two inputs -> adds the numbers together -> displays the result.**

**2) An multiplication example with libraries (numpy) imported into Python code.**

## 🔬 Observations

| Characteristic         | Detail                                      |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Inputs**      | No Problem with 1 / N inputs -----> 1 / M outputs. The MATLAB function block automatically recognizes the model's inputs/outputs through the code and thus adjusts what is needed. Then you just need to tweak variables/dimensions/connections, etc.                              |
| **Python Support**  | Simulink may not directly support the Python language. Therefore, scripts that take blocks_of_code must be written exclusively in MATLAB functions. In other words, the code must be converted from Python => MATLAB.                           |
| **Dimensions**| Special attention must be paid to the dimensions of the variables, otherwise the model will not run. (They can be changed by clicking on function_block > Edit Data > Symbols ( & Property Inspector).                              |
